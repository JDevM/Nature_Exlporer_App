I made a change to the way things are printed to the screen 

It solved the multiple instance problem, 
but now the function that prints is skipping 
some locations 

Its because we reduced the array of numbers 
being sent to the print function

We need a way to make sure nothing gets skipped

To reset, comment out the lines for the reduce functions
and replace the arguments going into the sort functions
with the original number arrays

-------------------------------------------------------------

As far as the solution, 
maybe a different .length of an array would help 
in the print functions 

or maybe an or statement or an else statement

if something.elevation matches elevations[i], 
check to see if anything else matches that same elevations[i]
if so, print that too

-------------------------------------------------------------

NEVERMIND!!! A Pleasant surprize!!!

The Mountains page  - I verifited that all locations are shown!
The Lakes page      - I verifited that all locations are shown!
The Waterfalls page - I (have not yet) verifited that all locations are shown!
